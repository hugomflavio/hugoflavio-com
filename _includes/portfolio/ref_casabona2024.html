                Many coastal ecosystems are impacted by several human pressures that are increasing in coverage and rate. Rocky reefs are structurally complex habitats that often support elevated fish abundance and biodiversity. In the Baltic Sea, rocky reefs have suffered from extraction for decades, leading to a decrease in hard substrata and complex habitat availability. This study is the first to restore cobble reefs and examine the biological effects. Ecosystem restoration was undertaken by deploying cobble reefs in January 2018. Baited and unbaited underwater video systems (BRUVS and UBRUVS, respectively) were employed across five years to monitor fish communities before reef deployment in 2017 and after reef deployment in 2018 and 2021. Using a before-after control-impact (BACI) study design with replicates, relative abundances of Atlantic cod (<em>Gadus morhua</em>), herring (<em>Clupeidae sp.</em>), goldsinny wrasse (<em>Ctenolabrus rupestris</em>), two-spotted goby (Gobiusculus flavescens), shore crab (<em>Carcinus maenas</em>), and flatfish (Pleuronectiformes spp.) were determined and compared across time and test sites. Comparisons were conducted across 1) restored cobble reefs, 2) natural cobble reefs, and 3) sand-bottom test sites. This study found positive reef restoration effects revealed both by BRUVS and UBRUVS in three of our six focal species: Atlantic cod, goldsinny wrasse and two-spotted goby. These findings indicate that A) it is possible to restore cobble reefs and the associated fauna, but also that B) continued marine extraction of cobble degrades complex habitats to the detriment of a range of marine species. Cobble reef restoration might be a potential conservation tool to be applied in areas that have undergone cobble extraction. In order to preserve Atlantic cod, and other sensitive species, we emphasise ecosystem restoration and warn against marine cobble reef extraction in vulnerable areas.
